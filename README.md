Tsugi Node LTI Library in JavaScript
====================================

This starts as a conversion of the Owen Smith repo from CoffeeScript to JavaScript.

   https://github.com/omsmith/ims-lti/
  
From that point the code will evolve as needed to build the Node Tsugi layer 
atop of this code.

For the time being, his is called "tmp" because at some point, if all my modifications can be put
into the original CoffeeScript version, then Tsugi-node could easily depend on
that code.  My preference would be to only have one version of that code.  But 
at least for now, I do not have time nor inclination to learn CoffeeScript.
